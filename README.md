# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is a role-based application designed for efficient user and task management. It allows administrators to create, update, delete, and read user and task information. The system provides dynamic roles that can be assigned to users at the time of creation, with permissions determined by the admin. Users receive real-time notifications when tasks are added, and email notifications for critical updates like new task assignments and user creation.
